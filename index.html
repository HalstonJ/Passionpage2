                Boston Terriers<br>
                <h6>Boston terriers are a breed of dog that originated in the U.S. from the results of mixing an English Bulldog and a white English Terrier. They are loveable and extremely energetic little dogs, that love attention and play. However, before you consider getting one there are some factors in deciding whether a Boston Terrier would be right for you.</h6>
